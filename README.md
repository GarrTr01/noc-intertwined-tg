# IOG Architecture Triage // NOC as a service


This service is defined as the NOC’s response time to requests.  



## Overview

Throughout the day, the NOC receives hundreds of emails; It’s the NOC’s responsibility to process each request individually and assist to the fullest extent of their (our) ability. Once a member of the NOC evaluates a request, alert, or notification, they must understand the situation and escalate the task promptly. 
## Feature Requests

New tools have been given to the NOC to increase success rate and productivity, but elevating the rate at which the NOC can escalate alerts could be proven desirable. This would include new monitoring dashboards, higher tier computing systems, and deeper training.  More individual employee gratitude might also prove beneficial in this sense.
## Objectives

•	Availability - 99.9% availability 24x7 including Holidays.

•	Response Time – 99.9% of non-production impacting tasks completed within 5 minutes of the initial request, 99.9% of production impacting tasks completed within 3 minutes of the initial request. 

•	Accuracy – 95% accuracy of all Severities, outstanding iSIT tickets, and monitoring escalation.
